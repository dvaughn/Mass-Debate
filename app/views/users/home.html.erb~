<h1>User#Home - The Profile Page</h1>
<p> This will be the profile page for each user, or their "home" </p>

<p> 
  If you look in the user's controller, you will see that for the home action we bascially do nothing except
  set a variable @user that represents the current user's object. Below is an example of how you call some of the attributes.
</p>

<h2> Welcome, <%= @user.firstName + " " + @user.lastName %> </h2>
<p> 
  It is literally just injecting ruby code between the special syntax angle brackets
  and the percentage signs. Now to finish out the rest of the attributes:
</p>

<h3> Email: <%= @user.email %> </h3>
<h3> Debate Name: <%= @user.debateName %> </h3>
<h3> Age: <%= @user.age %> </h3>
<h3> Gender: <%= @user.gender %> </h3>
<h3> Avg. Duration of Debate: <%= @user.email %> </h3>
<h3> Number of Debates: <%= @user.email %> </h3>
<h3> Upvotes: <%= @user.email %> </h3>
